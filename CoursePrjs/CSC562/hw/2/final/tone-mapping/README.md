# Description
This Final projects include two independent programs.One is a demo of optical illusion,which is shows by two group circles with the same size of centers.Another one is an implemention of tone-mapping,which contains 3 tone-mapping algorithm:
  - None tone-mapping shows display original color form texture files.
  - ReinhardToneMapping shows display HDR textures with  Reinhard tone-mapping algorithm
  - FilmicTonemapping shows display HDR textures with  Filmic tone-mapping algorithm

# Directions
  - optical illusion there are four buttons to control this program,they are 'reset' :reset all parameters; 'move':when users check this,those circles will move in different directions;'show surroundings':this button will display surroundings circles of the centers;'alpha':it will enable display circles transparently.
  - tone-mapping this program is easy to control.It include a slider to set the value of 'exposure'.It will change the outcome of  'ReinhardToneMapping' and 'FilmicTonemapping'


# Claims 
- tone-mapping within this program ,I used a algorithm and some code to parse hdr file.This is the authors'link  https://www.npmjs.com/package/parse-hdr. I also use the display framework  from here(https://ncsucg4games.github.io/prog2/)
